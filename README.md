## Purpose

In Minecraft, having to go back and fix blocks that you accidentally placed or
destroyed is time-consuming and annoying. BuildRegion is a user interface
enhancement client mod, designed to help you avoid these little accidents.

BuildRegion is *not* an auto-build tool. It will only prevent you from
misclicking; it will not click for you.

BuildRegion is [open source](https://github.com/bencvt/BuildRegion)!

## Usage

To get started, hold `control` on your keyboard and `right-click` your mouse.
This will make a grid appear in front of you. As long as the grid is active,
you can only build inside that region. Use `control-left-click` to remove the
build region.

You can easily redefine the region: just move around or face a different
direction, then `control-right-click` again. You can also move the region
around using `[` and `]`.

Note that if you're using a Mac, use `command (âŒ˜)` instead of `control`. If
you prefer to use a keyboard shortcut instead of the mouse, `shift-[` and
`shift-]` also work to clear and set the build region, respectively.

Additionally, pressing `B` will cycle to the next build region mode. The grid
will change color to indicate the new mode. There are three possibilities:

 1.  *inside*: you can only place or destroy blocks inside the grid.
 2.  *outside*: you can only place or destroy blocks outside the grid.
 3.  *display*: the grid is visible but it doesn't affect block placement.

Finally, press `shift-B` to get a list of all commands (i.e., a short version
of everything you just read.)

## Installation

Installing this mod works exactly the same as any other Minecraft client mod.

1.  Make sure the following two required mods are installed:
    [ModLoader](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/75440-modloader/) and
    [LibShapeDraw](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1458931-libshapedraw/).
2.  Download and extract the zip for the latest release.
3.  Patch the contents of the zip file into your `minecraft.jar`, being sure to
    remove the `META-INF` folder.

Utilities like [Magic Launcher](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/939149-/)
can automate this process. Highly recommended! Manually copying `.class` files
is for the birds.

## Compatibility

BuildRegion should be compatible with every mod that does not modify the
PlayerControllerMP class (`atc.class`, as of Minecraft 1.3.2).
