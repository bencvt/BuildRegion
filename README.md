In Minecraft, having to go back and fix blocks that you accidentally placed or
destroyed is time-consuming and annoying. BuildRegion is a user interface
enhancement mod, designed to help you avoid these little accidents.

BuildRegion can also help you make circles and other shapes, giving you a
dynamic blueprint right there in the world.

BuildRegion is *not* an auto-build tool. It will only prevent you from
misclicking; it will not click for you. It's all client-side, meaning you can
use this on multi-player without the server having to run a special plugin.

See the [official minecraftforums.net thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1514724-buildregion/)
for screenshots and a demo video.

## Installation

Installing this mod works exactly the same as any other Minecraft client mod.

1.  Make sure that
    [LibShapeDraw](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1458931-libshapedraw/)
    is installed as it is a base requirement. You'll also need
    [ModLoader](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/75440-modloader/) or
    [Forge](http://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/); BuildRegion is compatible
    with either.
2.  Download and extract the zip for the latest release.
3.  Patch the contents of the zip file into your `minecraft.jar`, being sure to
    remove the `META-INF` folder.

Utilities like [Magic Launcher](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/939149-/)
can automate this process. Highly recommended! Manually copying `.class` files
is for the birds.

Also, if you prefer to place the zip file in the `mods/` directory instead of
patching `minecraft.jar` directly, you can.

## Compatibility

BuildRegion does not modify *any* vanilla classes directly and therefore should
be compatible with virtually every mod. Forge is supported but *not* required.

By necessity, BuildRegion does set up a "PlayerControllerMP proxy" internally,
which could potentially be a source of some incompatibilies. If you find an
incompatible mod please post to
[the minecraftforums thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1514724-buildregion/)
or [open an issue on github](https://github.com/bencvt/BuildRegion/issues)
and we'll try to sort it out.

## Usage

To get started, hold `control` on your keyboard and `right-click` your mouse.
This will make a grid appear in front of you. As long as the grid is active,
you can only build inside that region. Use `control-left-click` to remove the
build region.

You can easily redefine the region: just move around or face a different
direction, then `control-right-click` again. You can also move the region
around using `[` and `]`.

If you're using a Mac, use `command (âŒ˜)` instead of `control`. If you prefer
to use a keyboard shortcut instead of the mouse, `shift-[` and `shift-]` also
work to clear and set the build region, respectively.

Additionally, you can press `B` to change how the build region works:

 *   *Blue (default)*: you can only place or destroy blocks *inside* the grid.
 *   *Red*: you can only place or destroy blocks *outside* the grid.
 *   *Green and white*: the grid is for *display* only; it won't affect block
     placement.

Finally, press `shift-B` to get a list of all commands (i.e., a short version
of everything you just read.)
